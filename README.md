# arsinstall
ARS automated installation software

This code assumes that you have a few things:
\nGit,
A computer that meets requirements for SARNDBOX,
Nvidia Drivers,
Sudo,
and a full account (not a guest one!)

To get this software, run `git clone https://github.com/TheSquashyMaker/arsinstall/master/arsinstall.git`
then `cd ~/arsinstall`
then `sudo chmod a+x ./install.sh`
then `sudo ./install.sh`
and then let the software take it from there.
